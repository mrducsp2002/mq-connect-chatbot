    "text": "Home Articles Services My Requests More Search\"\" Profile Logout Managing My Assessments, Exams & Results 19 Aug 2025 Knowledge Supporting evidence is a requirement of an application for Special Consideration. It determines if your application is eligible and impacts what the outcome to your application will be.  Supporting evidence must: identify the nature of the circumstances include dates and/or the length of the circumstances explain the severity and impact of the circumstances clearly describe how the circumstances have adversely affected your capacity for effective study related to the assessment/exam include the date(s) on which you were seen by the professional providing the evidence (if applicable)  Recommended supporting evidenceVarious documentation types can be used as supporting evidence, the below table outlines the recommended forms of evidence based on the disruption type. For a full list of acceptable evidence forms see theSpecial Consideration Supporting Evidence Schedule.  Official letter and/or documents from the relevant source/authority. For example: Wedding invitations accompanied by Statutory Declaration or Statement of Fact* Letter from religious leader/Elder Letter from employer stating why you cannot be released from the unexpected work commitments Letter from doctor/medical certificate Letter confirming your attendance to Jury Duty/court date  Here are answers to some frequently asked questions about supporting evidence:  A Statement of Fact can be used as supporting evidence: for all event/disruption types other than Elite Athlete commitments, if the event/disruption duration is 5 days or less, if it is used only once per assessment task (it cannot be used for the same assessment task more than once or to request a further outcome for the same assessment task). Multiple uses of a Statement of Fact in relation to the same disruption will be considered as a disruption that is longer than 5 days in duration, formal evidence will likely be requested instead.  If your Statement of Fact does not include sufficient detail, or if it does not allow for your circumstances to be confirmed as serious and unavoidable, it will not be accepted. Please provide independently corroborated forms of documentation that clearly demonstrate serious and unavoidable circumstances.  You do not have to include other evidence when applying, however you may be requested to provide additional supporting evidence when your application is reviewed. If you are able to obtain recommended supporting documentation forms, please use these documents rather than a Statement of Fact.  A RAT will not be accepted. Provide other medical evidence such as a medical certificate.  If your supporting evidence is not in English it cannot be assessed. This will result in your application being rejected for insufficient evidence.  It is a MQ form that students can have their health professional complete to then use as your supporting evidence. This includes all the relevant details your health professional needs to provide and can simply your application process. Students can access the MQ PAF via thefollowing link.  The university reviews all supporting evidence provided in Special Consideration applications.  Where misleading or fraudulent information/documents are submitted, this will be reported to the Complaints, Appeals and Misconduct Unit.  Any application with misleading or fraudulent information will be denied Special Consideration, and the likely outcome is 0% for the assessment task.  No further consideration for that assessment task will be given should other evidence be provided.  Related Special Consideration articles What is Special Consideration and how do I apply?

For all other adjustment types refer to your IEAP for instructions.  Here are answers to some frequently asked questions about how and when to use your planned IEAP extension via Special Consideration:  If you are experiencing ongoing circumstances such as chronic illness, disability or carer commitments, you should explore support options such as reasonable adjustments offered through Accessibility Services at Student Wellbeing.  If you are registered with Accessibility Services, you may be eligible for reasonable adjustments for your studies, and this will simplify the circumstances in which you would need to apply for Special Consideration.  Special Consideration is applicable to short-term, serious, and unavoidable circumstances only.  Your IEAP planned extension can only be applied from the original assessment due date. If you have already received an approved Special Consideration extension and still require extra time, you cannot then submit a Planned Extension application.   Supporting evidence requirements vary based on your reason for applying. If you have an adjustment for planned extension listed on your IEAP and you wish to use that extension, you will need to request this on yourSpecial Consideration formunder the event category of 'Planned extension with IEAP adjustment'. You do not need to attach any evidence to your application.  If you are unable to complete an assessment task due to other impacts separate to that of your IEAP or experience an additional disruption, you will need to provide valid forms ofsupporting evidence.  Your IEAP can only be used to request one extension per assessment task. After this, you will need to provide other valid forms of supporting evidence.  Important:An IEAP planned extension provision can be applied towards eligible assessment types only. Please refer to your IEAP for details as to which assessments are covered by your IEAP.  Planned extension adjustments cannot be used for missing quiz/tests/exams or to request extra time to complete a quiz/test/exam.  If you are unable to sit a quiz/test/exam at the scheduled date/time, you will need to apply for special consideration, providing evidence relating to the disruption that has prevented you from sitting the quiz/test/exam.  Extra time for tests, quizzes, or exams will be applied as per the listed adjustments on your students IEAP (eg. 25% extra time) â you do not need to submit a special consideration request to have your extra time adjustments applied.  You can apply for your IEAP extension forlong-form individual written assessments only.  The following assessments tasks arenot coveredunder this recommended adjustment: short written tasks in-class/online tests exams/supplementary exams presentations group work activities weekly tasks PACE/placement take home assignments and exams class attendance clinical and practical assessment tasks timed assessments  We will review your IEAP extension request and will aim to respond within five working days.  You should continue to work on your assessment task while you wait for the notification of the outcome of your request. If you do not hear a response prior to the due date, you should work towards submitting the assessment task on the due date aligned with your IEAP.

You may add more than one unit and/or assessment to your application form. To add more units/assessment to your form use the 'Add' button.  If your unit doesnât appear as an option in your Special Consideration form it is because you are no longer enrolled in the unit. If you have received a result (eg P, F, FA), and you believe itâs incorrect due to a previously approved Special Consideration, you may need to submit a Grade Appeal instead. Once final results are released, you canât use Special Consideration to explain something thatâs already affected your grade.â Reminder: Special Consideration needs to be submitted within 5 working days of the assessment due date.   After Applying  Please check your outcome email which will explain: why your application was not approved, and/or may have advice or instructions for further actions if appropriate.

We recommend you consult the Special Consideration articles and policy prior to submitting an appeal. Applications must be submitted no later than five working days after the assessment due date.

    "text": "Home Articles Services My Requests More Search\"\" Profile Logout Managing & Understanding My Enrolment 4 July 2025 Knowledge At The College, enrolment for each Term closes at 9pm on the Sunday before each Term begins. However, during the first week of Term, students can request Late Enrolment. If approved, you will be manually enrolled into your requested units and registered for classes. The number ofÂ  units you can be Late Enrolled in depends on how soon you apply: If you apply before 12pm (midday) on Wednesday of Week 1,andyour application can be approved, you can be Late Enrolled intoTwo Units. If you apply after 12pm on Wednesday, but before 12pm on Friday of Week 1,andyour application can be approved, you can be Late Enrolled intoOne Unit. Any applications submitted after 12pm on Friday of Week 1 will not be approved. Submit theLate Unit Enrolment Formvia theService Connect Portal. If you need assistance, just come to The Student Hub to see an Advisor without needing an appointment any time between 9am and 4pm during the first week of Term (Ground Floor, 8 Sir Christopher Ondaatje Avenue).  Quick Tip:To make sure that your application has the best chance of being approved be sure to: Update your personal address and contact details. Clear any sanctions you may have on your account - if you have any sanctions, your request will not be approved. When you apply, make sure you check the Handbook to ensure the units you are applying for are available in the current Term. Be sure you write the correct Unit Code in your application, and make sure all the information is accurate. Also, make sure you already meet the Prerequisites for enrolment in your selected unit. If you don't meet the prerequisites, you won't be approved!  But What If I'm Not Approved? If you aren't approved for late enrolment, we recommend contacting a College Student Advisor at The Student Hub ASAP so they can help plan your remaining units. If this is during Week 1 of a Term, just come to The Student Hub to see an Advisor without needing an appointment. You can also submit an enquiry using theService Connect Portal. Additionally, if you are an International Student, a rejected Late Enrolment will mean either you will be studying 1 unit (part-time) or have no units at all. If this is the case, you will now need to either apply for a Reduced Study Load (for 1 unit) or a Suspension of Studies (for no units) as soon as possible to prevent the cancellation of your eCoE and the discontinuation of your course. These applications must be submitted by the Census day (Friday of Week 3). It is highly recommended you met with a Student Advisor before submitting either application.

Academic Appealsare when you request that the University review the process by which a decision was made. Appeals do not review the merits of that decision; instead, the focus is on the decision-making process. For example, you can appeal because you believe a Grade Appeal was not conducted fairly, but you cannot appeal the outcome of a Grade Appeal because you disagree with the outcome of the Grade Appeal. Your appeal must clearly identify how the procedure for dealing with your issue was unfair, and detail that one or more the following grounds for appeal occurred: the required procedure for making the decision was not followed there was a lack of procedural fairness in making the decision new information has become available that was not available at the time the decision was made and which should be taken into consideration. You must provide reasoning and supporting information to show that the decision made by the University was unfair due to one of the grounds listed above. You must also demonstrate that as a result of one of these grounds existing or occurring, the decision was substantially unfair. Your appeal will be unsuccessful if you are unable to demonstrate that one of the grounds existed or occurred and that the decision was substantially unjust.  You may appeal any of the following types of decisions and the relevant timeframes are: 10 working days Admission or re-admission to a degree Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) Academic integrity breaches (breaches or penalty decisions, except Suspension or Exclusion) Special Consideration Enrolment and Leave of Absence Withdrawal (including Withdrawal Without Penalty) Outcome of a Grade Appeal 20 working days Academic Pause or Exclusion under the Academic Progression policy Academic integrity breaches (Suspension or Exclusion penalties) Exclusion under the General Coursework Rules Suspension of Studies Notice of Intent to Report Fitness to practice requirement under the Fitness to Practice Procedure Termination of candidature (Higher Degree Research) Award of PhD, MPhil or MRes degree Research degree enrolment, leave of absence and withdrawal decisions under the Higher Degree Research Variations to Candidature Policy Please note that late appeals can only be accepted if you can show circumstances beyond your control which prevented you from submitting your appeal on time.

When transferring to most double degrees, you must complete the core components of both single degrees that you wish to transfer to. This means that you may not have a flexible zone in your new degree program When transferring to a double degree, you will be admitted to the latest curriculum for both degrees. For example, if a Bachelor of Archeology students from 2021 adds a Bachelor of Information Technology, they would have both degrees updated to the 2025 curriculum. If you have further questions about your course transfer's impact, please refer toCourse Guidance.  If you wish to transfer to any of the teacher education degrees, you must be aware of the following information.

This survey will be emailed to you as part of the Course Transfer process and is a requirement for your future accreditation as a teacher. If you do not complete this survey, your Course Transfer cannot be processed.  Important:The data collected from this survey also helps to provide relevant and effective learning experiences for Teacher Education students enrolled in Macquarie Universityâs courses. It is reported annually to NESA as part of our accreditation requirements. You may also be required to meet with an academic from the School of Education regarding your responses.  If you want to make changes to your course, it is important to understand how your fees will be impacted. Domestic students Legislation changes have impacted the student contribution rates from 2021.

Information about course requirements and the Curriculum Architecture can also be found in theCurriculum Architecture Policy.  A minor is a sequence of undergraduate units drawn from a major or specialisation but with a smaller volume of learning requirement. A minor must be 40 credit points, of which 20 credit points must be completed at 2000 level or above.  A major consists of 80 credit points, of which 30 credit points must be at 3000 level. The list of eligible qualifying majors for a degree are included in the courseâs 'major schedule' in the Course Handbook.  The Flexible Zone major may be chosen from all available majors listed in the Handbook. The major will be added from the year that you commenced your course. If the major is not available in your course year but is available in a future year, the major will be added from the first available year after your course commencement year.  If you are admitted into a double degree, you will need to complete the core zone of each component single degree. Your major, minor, and specialisation requirements will be determined by the requirements of the individual single degrees. There are unit sharing restrictions within double degrees, which mean that students are unable to complete a specialisation or major where it is possible to choose a combination of units which share more than 50 per cent of credit points in common 1000 level and above with: a major or specialisation from the other course, or the core zone of the other course (outside any major or specialisation)  Masters degrees may require completion of a specialisation in the core zone. In postgraduate specialist courses, specialisations will constitute 50 per cent of a courseâs core zone units. Where applicable, the list of eligible specialisations for a Masters degree is included in the courseâs 'specialisation schedule' in theCourse Handbook.

This means you should arrive to Registration 90 minutes before the ceremony start time so that your attendance can be confirmed, and you can be gowned.  The registration room at the Mezzanine Floor on 1 Central Courtyard (1CC_ opens 90 minutes before your ceremony. You will be directed to use the QR codes provided to register your attendance and proceed to academic dress fitting. Your guests may proceed to the Lower Ground Floor on 1 Central Courtyard where guest entry is located.

This is sent approximately a week before the ceremony series commences. On the day of the graduation ceremony, order of proceedings are as follows: Your graduation ceremony will commence with the entry of the academic procession into the Graduation Hall lead by the Registrar carrying the Ceremonial Staff. The Presiding Officer of your ceremony is the last member of the procession to enter the Graduation Hall. The Presiding Officer is preceded by the Mace Bearer who carries the University Mace â which is the symbol of his or her authority. When the members of the academic procession have taken their place on the dais, the musical group will play Advance Australia Fair. Trenchers are removed for the National Anthem. At the conclusion of the National Anthem, the audience resume their seats, and the ceremony will be formally opened with a brief welcome. The Presiding Officer will open the proceedings. The Registrar will ask all graduands to stand and testify that the Academic Senate of the University has certified that you have completed the requirements for the award of your degree or your diploma. The presiding Officer will then, by the authority conferred on them by the Council of the University, admit you to the degree or diploma for which you have qualified. At this point, you become a graduate. Each row of graduates is guided by the graduation staff around to the northern end of the dais, where your graduation document will be given to you in a presentation folder, which will be part of your presentation photograph with the Presiding Officer. Each graduate is presented individually to the Presiding Officer, in the order set out in the printed graduation program, by the Executive Dean of their Faculty (or their nominee). The Presiding Officer will pose for a photograph with each graduate at this point. After the photograph, do not go down the steps at the centre of the stage, proceed across the dais and exit via the ramp at the back of the dais before returning to the graduation seating area. At the end of the presentation of the graduates, there is a graduate address followed by brief musical interlude. The Presiding Officer will speak briefly before closing the proceedings. The presiding Officer will lead the academic procession from the dais. The Registrar will be the last member of the academic procession to leave the dais, which will then be followed by graduates joining the academic procession.  Your Graduation Fee will include academic dress hire/purchase, and all graduands are required to be in full academic dress to take part in the graduation proceedings.

Session 3 units have the same amount of content as Session 1 or 2 units, but rather than lasting 13 weeks like Sessions 1 and 2, Session 3 is roughly half that length, so you have more classes/content to complete each week per unit than in a normal session. Because of this \"condensed mode\", you can only study one or two units in Session 3. Studying two Session 3 units is an equivalent workload to studying four units in a normal session. Studying in Session 3 is not mandatory, but it can be a great opportunity to catch up or get ahead in your studies. Not every unit is taught in Session 3, but you can search theCourse Handbookto find units available in Session 3 by choosing the 'Advanced Search' option under the search bar on the Course Handbook homepage, then searching 'Units' and filtering 'Study Period' to 'Session 3'. This shows all units taught in Session 3 in the selected year. You can also add other filters, so you can find Session 3 units taught by different departments or faculties, or units at different 'levels.' Please ensure you finalise your enrolment by thelast date to enrolfor the study period. If you need assistance enrolling, please viewEnrolling.

We have a legal obligation to provide information and to notify the DHA in specific circumstances such as changes to your enrolment and breaches of university policies.  Here are answers to some frequently asked questions about Student Visa Conditions:  While on a student visa, you must comply with your student visa conditions set by the Australian Government. If these conditions are breached, it may lead to the cancellation of your visa by the Department of Home Affairs (DHA). Please refer to theDepartment of Home Affairsto review the conditions on your student visa.  As an international student on a student visa, it is mandatory to remain enrolled in your course and meet the course requirements throughout your studies. If you are at risk of not satisfying the course progression requirements, we strongly recommend seekingCourse Guidanceto address any concerns. ELICOS or Foundation Program students must also maintain the minimum requirement for attendance. Please visit theMacquarie University College Attendance Policyfor further information.  It is unlawful to stay in Australia without a valid visa. If you do not have a valid visa to stay in Australia, please contact theDepartment of Home Affairs (DHA)to check how this may impact you.  As an international student on a student visa, it is important that you keep your details up to date. If your contact details change, you must notify us viaeStudentwithin 7 days of your arrival in Australia or whenever you change your details during your stay in Australia.

You must be enrolled in at least one unit that is offered in-person (internal study mode) per compulsory study period (Session 1 & 2 and Term 1 to 4). The only exception to this requirement is if you are completing the last unit of your course which is only available online.  If you complete your last unit offshore, your CoE will be cancelled, and your international student visa may be affected. This will mean that you may not be eligible for the Post Study Work Rights (PSWR) visa 485.  Things to note Please note that whilst we can provide general advice about your CoE and visa conditions, we are unable to provide further specific advice.
